            >I'm highly passionate when it comes to learning all sort of things.
            That's what keeps me going in life. These days I'm borderline
            obsessed about CS. Programming is a new challenge/ passion for me
            which I took very seriously and I won't slow down until I feel like
            I achieved some level of <em class="diff-text">mastery</em>. Then
            the actual fun begins. Until that moment, it's all about
            self-discipline, continuous learning and tremendous patience. I, in
            one word: <q class="diff-text">DRIVEN</q>
          </small>
          <hr />
          <p class="text-secondary">
            My life philosophy goes something like this:
          </p>
          <small>
            <strong
              >The level of your success can be found in your daily routine.
            </strong>
            <hr style="margin-bottom: .2rem;" />
            Just like <span class="diff-text">Aristotle</span> said:
            <blockquote class="sunflower">
              "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act,
              but a habit."
            </blockquote>

            And in the words of the infamous
            <em class="diff-text">Howard Hughes:</em>
            <blockquote class="sunflower">
              "Don't tell me I can't do it; Don't tell me it can't be done."
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text-secondary">
              But my very own personality is a little bit different:
            </p>
            <span class="primary-color"
              ><p>
                We'll do it together. If it's not working, it's time to change
                our daily routines and start thinking outside the box. I like to
                collaborate, to share knowledge and positive vibes. I'm a true
                team player. But what can affect me in a negative way is someone
                claiming something can't be done, especially project-related.
                Okay, maybe he/ she is right about the first part, but if I
                can't do it by myself, then
                <span class="diff-text"> <em>WE</em></span> can absolutely
                achieve it together. I stand corrected, so please just don't
                share the rumor that something is undoable. Let's stay calm,
                focused, driven, and by the end of the day let's make this work.

      <p>
        I truly believe that people working in this industry are building our
        future. A more prosperous future, which, in addition to being much more
        efficient, is also a safer one. My desire is to be a part of it, a small
        part of that team. The winning team. My goal is to contribute to the
        resolution that will be the solution to the situation we are all in
        today and which differs significantly from the one in which we were in
        previous years (still to this day). I'm craving to be a small part of
        the change. In order for me to become that, I'm willing to change
        myself, change what I do on a daily basis, learn harder and smarter, and
        become better every single day. To achieve just that, in my humble
        opinion, programming is the way to go. In other words, when I found
        coding, I found my passion, my purpose, I found myself.
